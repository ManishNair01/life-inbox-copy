# Architecture

## Stack

- **API:** FastAPI
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Migrations:** Alembic (authoritative schema owner)
- **DB:** SQLite locally (temp/test DBs for development)
- **UI:** HTML + vanilla JS/CSS
- **AI:** OpenAI optional; deterministic fallback organizer always available

## Core modules

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app/main.py` | HTTP routes, error shaping |
| `app/database.py` | Models, persistence helpers, fingerprints, task upsert |
| `app/schemas.py` | Request/response and analysis contracts |
| `app/organizer.py` | OpenAI + fallback organization |
| `app/templates` / `app/static` | Browser UI |

## Data model (current)

- `inbox_items` — canonical captures
- `notes` — legacy safety copy (not authoritative)
- `analysis_runs` — analyze attempts + JSON result (includes inbox fingerprint)
- `item_insights` — latest AI category/title/priority per item
- `tasks` / `task_source_items` — durable tasks linked to sources

## Analysis freshness

Successful analysis stores an `inbox_fingerprint` hash of inbox content.
`GET /api/analyze/latest` recomputes the hash and sets `is_stale` when the
inbox has changed since that run.

## Schema evolution

1. Change SQLAlchemy models
2. Add an Alembic revision under `migrations/versions/`
3. `alembic upgrade head` on empty and previous-milestone DBs in the quality gate

`LIFE_INBOX_AUTO_CREATE_TABLES=1` is allowed only for isolated automated tests.

## External services

Automated tests mock OpenAI and must not call paid APIs. Live calls are for
explicit manual smoke testing only.
